Udacity Project: Movie Trailer Website

> In this project I built a Movie Trailer Website where users can see my favorite movies lists,
and can also watch the trailers of it. 

. The code contains a list of movie titles, movie posters, and movie trailer URLs.
 
. All this information is displayed on a web page through code which also allow users to watch the trailers.

. This Movie Trailer Website Udacity Project consists of 3 python v3 files that store a list of movies titles, 
along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website. 

. The Movie Class in the media.py module creates a data structure to store your favorite movies, including movie title, 
box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.

. The entertainment_center.py file creates multiple instances of that Movie Class to represent your favorite movies and 
groups all the instances together in a list.

. The Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, 
which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which displays all of your favorite movies.
